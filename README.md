# APIs

## Okta Authentication

The Okta Authentication API provides operations to authenticate users, perform multifactor enrollment and verification, recover forgotten passwords, and unlock accounts. Primary authentication allows you to verify username and password credentials for a user.

## Google Maps API

Allows building of customized, agile experiences that bring the real world to our users with static and dynamic maps, Street View imagery, and 360Â° views.
This map uses the google-map-react library which is built on the Google Maps API.

- https://github.com/google-map-react/google-map-react#use-google-maps-api
- Requires Google Maps API key including: "Places", "Geocoding", "Maps" and "JavaScript" apis.
- Subscription to apis is available through the Google Maps Api api key dashboard.
- https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key

## Back-End API

Allows for access of locations of police incidents and details.

    *  DS_API_TOKEN - Secret Token for DS API
    *  DATABASE_URL - Postgres URL for our database, includes username, password, port and database name
    *  OKTA_URL_ISSUER - URL connecting authentification to Okta
    *  OKTA_CLIENT_ID - Client specific id for web dev
    *  REACT_APP_CLIENT_ID - Okta client specific id for front end
    *  REACT_APP_OKTA_ISSUER_URI - Okta URL connecting with authentification for front end
    *  REACT_APP_API_URI - API URL for back end API
    *  REACT_APP_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY - Google Maps API key
